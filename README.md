# EDA_Modeling 

In the EDA and Modeling file you will see the efforts I take in cleaning the data and performing modeling on the data. 

The data and exploration thereof is for a competition hosted on kaggle for determing whether tweets reference disasters. 

The data really on consists of two files, a test and training set. As you can see in the file I am hosting the files on S3 and reading them from there.
